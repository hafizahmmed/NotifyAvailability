This app asks the user for a URL and a search string. Then it creates a background task to notify the user if that string is present on the URL.

This app is created when you want to check the availability of some text on a website in the background and get notified when it is available.

Now you can also select whether to load Mobile View of the website or the desktop view.

It is created using React Native.
